## 📺 OBS Browser Source Setup

This overlay is designed to be used as an **OBS Browser Source**. It grows dynamically based on your stream activity (chat, subs, gifts).

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. In OBS, click the **+** button under Sources
2. Select **Browser**
3. Give it a name (like "Living Garden" or "Valentines Bouquet" 🩷)
4. Set the **URL** to:
   ```
   https://melty1000.github.io/MELTY-SB-Valentines-Living-Garden/
   ```
5. Set **Width** to your stream width (e.g., 1920)
6. Set **Height** to your stream height (e.g., 1080)
   - *Note: The garden is responsive, but 1920x1080 is recommended for best scaling.*
7. Set the **FPS** to match your stream framerate (30 or 60)
8. ✅ Check **"Shutdown source when not visible"** (saves resources when hidden)
9. ✅ Check **"Refresh browser when scene becomes active"** (keeps the connection fresh)
10. Click **OK**
